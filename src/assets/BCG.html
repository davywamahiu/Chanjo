<p><strong>BCG Vaccine (TB vaccine)</strong></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Key</strong> <strong>vaccine facts</strong> </span></em></p>
<p>This vaccine gives protection against tuberculosis (TB) infection. It is 70-80% effective against the most severe forms of TB, such as TB meningitis. However, it is less effective in preventing the form of TB that affects the lungs. The BCG vaccine contains live bacteria that have been weakened (attenuated), so that they stimulate the immune system but do not cause disease in healthy people.</p>
<p>However the vaccine should not be given to people who are clinically immunosuppressed (either due to drug treatment or underlying illness). This is because the vaccine strain could replicate too much and cause a serious infection. This includes babies whose mothers have had immunosuppressive treatment while they were pregnant or breastfeeding. For more information see the MHRA's Drug Safety Update (April 2016) .</p>
<p>From August 2018, the UK is using the BCG vaccine manufactured in Denmark by AJ Vaccines (see the Patient Information Leaflet ). Before this, the UK was using an alternative BCG vaccine manufactured by InterVax. Who should have the vaccine? In the UK the BCG vaccine is not currently part of the routine childhood schedule. It is offered to those who are at higher risk of TB. The main risk groups for TB are: Babies and children under 5 who live in an area of the UK with a high rate of TB (more than 40 cases of TB per year for every 100,000 people).</p>
<p>In some areas of London, for example, all newborn babies are recommended to have the BCG vaccine. Having a parent or grandparent who was born in a country where there is a high rate of TB Living for three months or more in a country where is a high rate of TB Being in close contact for a prolonged period with someone who has pulmonary TB (TB affecting the lungs) Babies and children under 16 in any of these risk groups will usually be offered the BCG vaccine. The BCG vaccine does not work well in adults, but those aged up to 35 may also be offered the vaccine if their job has a high risk of contact with people or animals infected with TB. Adults are often given a skin test before they are offered the vaccine. This is to check whether they already have antibodies to TB (see 'More information about the vaccine' towards the bottom of the page).</p>
<p>People with a past history of TB should not receive the vaccine. This is because they have an increased risk of adverse reactions to the vaccine. Ingredients The BCG vaccine used in the UK contains strains of a bacterium closely related to the one that causes TB in humans. The bacterium used for the vaccine is called Mycobacterium bovis, which causes TB in animals such as cows and badgers. The bacteria in the vaccine are weakened (attenuated) so that they do not cause disease in healthy people.</p>
<p>Apart from the active ingredients (the antigens), the vaccine also contains small amounts of the following ingredients: sodium, potassium and magnesium salts glycerol, a common non-toxic stabiliser also used in foods citric acid Other brands of BCG vaccine used in other countries may contain different ingredients. If you are not in the UK, ask for the Patient Information leaflet for the vaccine you are offered. Side effects Very common side effect (affecting 9 out of 10 people): Hardness at the injection site, followed by a raised blister. Uncommon side effects (affecting up to 1 in 100 people at each dose):</p>
<p>Headache and a raised temperature (fever) An ulcer which develops from the blister at the injection site, two to six weeks after injection. This may be painful and take several weeks or months to heal fully. Swelling of lymph nodes in the armpit larger than 1 cm across An enlarged lymph node that becomes infected (lymphadenitis) Rare side effects (affecting up to 1 in 1000 people at each dose): More severe skin reactions. These usually heal within a few weeks.</p>
<p>Bone inflammation (osteitis or osteomyelitis) An abscess at the injection site Anaphylaxis As with any vaccine, medicine or food, there is a very small chance of a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). Anaphylaxis is different from less severe allergic reactions because it causes life-threatening breathing and/or circulation problems. It is always extremely serious but can be treated with adrenaline.</p>
<p>Health care workers who give vaccines know how to do this. In the UK between 1997 and 2003 there were a total of 130 reports of anaphylaxis following ALL immunisations. Around 117 million doses of vaccines were given in the UK during this period. This means that the overall rate of anaphylaxis</p>
